Contains code used for simulations of protocols commonly used in network analysis.
packet.py contains simulation code of a M/M/1 queue with negative exponetially distributed arrival times and transmission times.
wireless.py contains simulation code of an IEEE 802.11-Based Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) with adjustable number hosts and arrival rate. The simulation implements N backoff time instead of exponential backoff time.
